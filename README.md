Modified Spieglt's and Alex Young's work.

Thanks to Spieglt and Alex, this helped me deal with my client's issues for my Social Media Managing job.

Now the program is able to select 'Hide from Timeline' for the posts that don't have 'delete' or 'remove content'.

Fixed several bugs.

Sometimes the app loops when 'Show on Timline' appears after selecting 'Hide from Timeline'(both has the same tag with the same href as visibility option). In that case, you can break out of the loop by clicking 'more posts from 20XX' by yourself.

Enjoy!
